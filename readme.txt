Make sure you have the latest WordPress version installed. If nothing of these solutions help, please contact support.

= I use older version of WordPress, can I still use this plugin? =
It's highly recommended to update WordPress to the latest, since attackers target especially older versions of WP,
but yes, you can still use AGCA, if the latest version doesn't work for you, you can install an older version of AGCA.
You can check the **Development** tab on WordPress.org AGCA's page to see which AGCA version supports your version of WordPress.

jQuery is probably not loaded on the login page, or you have some JavaScript error on this page. Please open the browser's console and see what are the errors.
